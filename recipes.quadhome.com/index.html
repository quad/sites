		<h2 id=hera> hera: 10-minute flawless fusion pasta recipe </h2>

		<p>
			Cook spaghetti in separate pot until pre-al dente. In some olive oil, fry fair amount of chili flakes (best if you dry yourself so stronger) and minced garlic. Don't brown garlic, just release flavour. Add in some brown sugar. Add in defrosted shrimp or scallops or whatever, some butter. When almost cooked, add some soy sauce, and oyster sauce. Mix up and put in pasta to finish.

		<h2 id=anny> anny: roasted cauliflower and lentil salad </h2>

		<p> Ingredients: </p>

		<ul>
			<li>1/2 red onion
			<li>1 cup of black lentils (more if you want a bulkier meal)
			<li>1/2 cauliflower (this will give you enough for a side dish for 2 people, but you can do more or less depending on personal preference
			<li>Olive oil
			<li>Pepper
			<li>Salt
			<li>Coriander seeds, ground
			<li>Cumin, ground
		</ul>

		<p> Dressing: </p>

		<ul>
			<li>3 tablespoons Greek yoghurt
			<li>Mint leaves, dill if you have any (optional)
			<li>Lemon juice, about 1 tablespoon (but do it to taste)
			<li>Olive oil, drizzled on top
		</ul>

		<p> 2 optional things here depending on your ingredients: </p>

		<ul>
			<li>if you have sumac, it is great with the cauliflower here
			<li>if you have pomegranate seeds, they‚Äôre great in this salad too (but wait for lentils to cool before mixing through)
		</ul>

		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 180C
			<li>
				Break cauliflower into florets. Line oven tray with parchment paper. Throw florets into mixing bowl and coat with pinch of salt and lots of pepper and olive oil. Tip into single layer on tray - no overlapping so they don‚Äôt steam.<br />
				Roast for 20-30 minutes, turning florets over to other side halfway through.
			<li>
				Cook black lentils - usually 25-30 minutes in a pot is enough. Use salted water.<br />
				(Note: feel free to bulk up with other grains too - quinoa works well (I like black quinoa). Farro and pearl barley work less well though, you want something that has a bit of a bite to it)
			<li>Slice red onion finely (don‚Äôt dice). Heat up a pan. Coat with some oil - be generous. Once the oil is smoking throw in your red onion. Throw in ground coriander seed and ground cumin seeds. I am really generous with the quantity of spice - maybe half a teaspoon if you had to measure it, but really just some good generous shakes. Stir around the onion until it‚Äôs translucent. Kitchen will smell lovely. Remove and keep aside.
			<li>
				Assemble the salad. Let your ingredients cool slightly. I typically assemble with lentils on the bottom (drained from pan, then with some olive oil tossed through and salted to taste, then cauliflower florets on top, then onion on top.<br />
				You can serve with dressing on top, or dressing on the side.<br />
				For your dressing: mix your Greek yoghurt with some torn up mint leaves and dill. Mix lemon juice through. You don‚Äôt want the final consistency to be too liquid, you want it to be something that can coat the salad when you‚Äôre eating it.<br />
				Top everything with olive oil, salt and pepper to taste.
		</ol>

		<h2 id=tai> tai: oil noodles </h2>

		<p> Saut√©e in 2 tablespoons of oil (ideally peanut, but canola or other oils work) ~3 stalks chopped spring onions on lowest heat. Add chopped green part after. Cook until stalks clear, some browning / caremelising is üëå </p>

		<p> Cool noodles in meantime to al dente. Rinse with cold water to get rid of starchy water and stop over cooking. Drain. </p>

		<p>
			Add to spring onion oil:

			<ul>
				<li>1 tblspn sesame oil
				<li>2tblspn soy sauce
				<li>~ 1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar
				<li>If vinegar is not sweet variety also add 1 teaspoon sugar.
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p> Stir noodles through sauce. </p>

		<p> Adjust to taste. </p>

		<p> Optional: Add 1 teaspoon chilli oil. </p>

		<h2 id=judd> judd: japanese curry </h2>

		<p> Chop up your meat, your potatoes in quarters, your carrots, whatever you want to put in </p>
		<p> Stir fry it in a big pot, add stock or water, cook for 30 mins, then add <a href="https://shop.coles.com.au/a/national/product/s-b-curry-golden-medium-hot">a cube of curry</a> and cook for another 15 and it‚Äôs done </p>

		<p> (The secret ingredient is love) </p>

		<h2 id=toss> toss: eggplant, tomato and parsley </h2>

		<p> Chop eggplant, maybe like a one big one </p>
		<p> Boil tomato sauce </p>
		<p> Then a bush of parsley added at the end </p>
		<p> Bit of pepper and salt, maybe a few chilli flakes </p>

		<h2 id=mikael> mikael: salad </h2>

		<p> Apple, avocado, tomato, red onion salad with pan fried halloumi and for luxury sprinkle some mixed nuts on top </p>

		<p> For seasoning you just use olive oil and black pepper on the salad </p>

		<p> 2 apples, 3 tomatoes, 1 avocado, 1/2 red onion </p>

		<p> That's 2-3 servings depending on how hungry you are </p>

		<h2 id=jen> jen: omelette </h2>

		<p> Really simple. I usually use 3-4 eggs, add in some chopped spring onion, some salt, soy sauce, some pepper, sometimes I add in diced tomatoes. Then loosely beat it if I‚Äôm hungry and want the omelettes post haste and then cook over a low-med heat. I‚Äôd use a spoon or spatula and make little holes in areas of the omelette where it isn‚Äôt cooked yet and then once it‚Äôs all cooked I flip it üç≥ </p>

		<p> And have it with rice cos I‚Äôm not an animal </p>

		<h2 id=sienna> sienna: fried rice </h2>

		<ol>

			<li>Whisk an egg for 30 seconds. Chuck it in the wok and flip it so it‚Äôs crispy on both sides. Cut it up into tiny pieces</li>
			<li>Fist full of garlic, onion, ginger and galangal if ya got it and want some Malaysian feels. Fry it in the wok. After a little bit add yer veg. Move everything aside.</li>
			<li>Chuck in 1:2:3 mix of raw Chinese, raw jasmine and raw basmati rice into the wok. DO NOT USE DAY OLD RICE THATS A NOOB TRAP. Every 30 seconds, chuck in a bit of a mix of soy sauce, stock and water around the edges. Cover it for 30 seconds. Repeat until it‚Äôs cooked. If it gets stuck, add some water and oil.</li>
			<li>Mix it all together. If you want some extra fun, add some ground up coriander seeds, mustard seeds and a tiny bit of cumin and chopped dried chilli.</li>
			<li>Mix in some MSG</li>
			<li>Bonus points if you did it topless with a meat cleaver in your dominant hand</li>
		</ol>

		<h2 id=debbie> debbie: vegetarian tortilla </h2>

		<ul>
			<li>place tortilla on a low heat pan</li>
			<li>crack an egg and spread the egg whites around all surface area</li>
			<li>add a teaspoon of green peas (from a can / defrosted)</li>
			<li>add red onion (sliced thinly)</li>
			<li>crumble feta cheese on top</li>
			<li>sprinkle curry powder</li>
			<li>fold and cook tortilla until crispy caring not to break the yolk inside</li>
			<li>place on a plate and cut with a knife for egg to ooze out</li>
		</ul>

		<p> served with tomato salsa </p>

		<ul>
			<li>quarter the cherry tomatoes</li>
			<li>add olive oil, salt and pepper</li>
			<li>sprinkle some lemon juice to taste</li>
			<li>season with dried parsley</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id=jem> jem: a thing that I call pizza but isn't</h2>

		<p> Take a disc of Lebanese bread and lightly toast on both sides in a small amount of olive oil in a frypan. Take it out and layer on top: chopped chilli, sliced mushroom, diced tomato and a bit of whatever leftover meat (chicken, pork mince etc). Place under the grill making sure the edges don't burn. Plate it up and put on top a mound of salad leaves, some pickles & sauerkraut. Best to make a little of the pickle juice come along for the ride. To eat, gently fold two sides towards each other so you can stick it in your gob directly. See, it is not at all like pizza, but it is good. As you eat pickle juice will mix with the olive oil and fat from the meat and pool on your plate. Finish by licking the plate like a dog. Mmmm that's the ticket. </p>
